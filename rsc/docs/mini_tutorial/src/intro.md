# Introduction

*Memthol* is a visualizer and analyzer for program profiling. It works on memory *dumps* containing
information about the size and (de)allocation date of (some of) the allocations performed by some
execution of a program.

> For information regarding building memthol, features, browser compatibility... refer to the
> [memthol repository].

This tutorial deals with the BUI (**B**rowser **U**ser **I**nterface) aspect of the profiling. How
the dumps are generated is outside of the scope of this document. Currently, memthol accepts memory
dumps produced by [*Memtrace*][memtrace] (github repository [here][memtrace git]). A memtrace dump
for a program execution is a single [**C**ommon **T**race **F**ormat](https://diamon.org/ctf) (CTF)
file.

This tutorial uses CTF files from the memthol repository. All paths mentioned in the examples are
from its root.

Memthol is written in Rust and is composed of

- a server, written in pure Rust, and
- a client, written in Rust and compiled to web assembly.

The server contains the client, which it will serve at some address on some port when launched.

## Running Memthol

Memthol must be given a path to a CTF file generated by memtrace. 

```bash
> ls rsc/dumps/ctf/flamba.ctf
rsc/dumps/ctf/flamba.ctf
> memthol rsc/dumps/ctf/flamba.ctf
|===| Starting
| url: http://localhost:7878
| target: `rsc/dumps/ctf/flamba.ctf`
